The developed system provides an environment in which no user needed to control fan speed. Automatically control the fan speed by sensing the room  temperature . These fascinating efforts to create intelligent system are to provide human being a more convenient life. The circuit was designed using electronic components available in local market to keep the cost at low level.</b></dd></h3>
